## About Me

- **Name**: Samana Pranesh
- **Affiliation**: PhD Scholar, Department of Applied Mechanics, IIT Madras

## Research Interests

I am passionate about exploring and analyzing coupled non-linear dynamical systems using the principles of complex network theory. My research interests can be summarized as follows:

- **Coupled Non-Linear Dynamical Systems**: I am intrigued by the behavior of systems where multiple components interact, leading to non-linear dynamics. My research involves understanding and modeling these systems.

- **Complex Network Theory**: I apply concepts from complex network theory to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within coupled systems. Network theory provides valuable insights into the structure and dynamics of such systems.

- **High-Dimensional ODEs**: Solving high-dimensional coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) is a significant challenge in my research. I work on developing innovative methods to tackle this computational challenge effectively.
